# Notes

- Import of Git repository to IPFS has to be done manually rn.

- Helper supports "ipfs://" (well, because binary name is git-remote-ipfs),
but does not support "ipns://" (duh, we would need either another binary with name git-remote-ipns or at least symlink). Look into support for IPNS ??
